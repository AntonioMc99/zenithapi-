The Zenith API is a backend I built with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose to manage an ecommerce product catalog. It handles all the basics like creating, reading, updating, and deleting products, and also makes it easy to filter by 
category, price, or tags, sort results, and use pagination when the data gets large. It connects to MongoDB Atlas using environment variables to keep things secure, and I kept the project organized with separate folders for configuration, 
models, and routes. Honestly, the backend came together much more smoothly than the frontend, and I actually enjoyed working on this part a lot more.
